# ML-DL-Made-Easy
Overview:
Welcome to our book on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, designed to help you understand these complex topics in an easy and approachable way. 
This books comes from two students who are facing some problems learning ML and DL. So it comes as a challenge to make learning AI much easier and faster
for beginners who are seeking to develop their careers in the Artificial Intelligence field. 
This book is a collaboration between Roudayna Zorg and Aziz Souiai and covers a wide range of topics in the field of AI, 
from the basics of machine learning to more advanced concepts in deep learning, in a very simple way.

What You Will Learn: 
In this book, you will start with the basics of Machine Learning, dealing with data, supervised and unsupervised learning using Scikit-Learn.
Then we'll move to Deep Learning starting with neural networks and deep learning. then we'll jump on to more complex concepts such as CNNs, RNNs,
GANs, and LSTMs on NLP, Time Series, and much more ...
